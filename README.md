# Chat
##### Created by [Ren Burnett](https://github.com/renburnett), [Ian Hunter Harold](https://github.com/ianhunterharold) and [Krista Loven](https://github.com/kel29)

Chat is a topic based live communication tool. Built ontop of ActionCable sockets, users can join any existing conversation topic or start their own. 

## Why Chat?

Chat was an enjoyable project to dive into for building an understanding of sockets. This project gave our team a great learning opportunity to have some fun playing with sockets, providers, and learning about frontend to server communication. 

## Technology Used

Chat was build with JavaScript and React for its [frontend](https://github.com/kel29/chat-frontend). This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The backend was built using Ruby on Rails, taking advantage of ActionCables for socket functionality. User experience is complimented with Bootstrap styling. 

## DIY

Chat is not _yet_ deployed (but don't worry, were working on it). If you'd like to fork or clone down the code yourself, we'd love to have you check it out. Please note, you'll probably want to grab the [frontend](https://github.com/kel29/chat-frontend) as well to get the full experience. To get started, make sure to run `bundle install` before opening up the server with `rails server` . 

## Credits

Shout out to Dakota Lillie's [great blog post](https://medium.com/@dakota.lillie/using-action-cable-with-react-c37df065f296) that helped us move in the right direction. Also, the hero of this story is probably [React ActionCable Provider](https://github.com/cpunion/react-actioncable-provider), who's library made our lives a lot easier.
